# hello-world
Learning Data Science &amp; Machine Learning - AI Sciences
I am uite exited to be embarking on this journey of upskilling myself, to necessitate commitment that will be the impetus that lunges me into changing my career path. 
I am 32 year old male from Potchefstroom with a BCom Degree in Accounting Sciences, obtained from The University of Johannesburg in 2012. 
I worked in the field for some years before an opportunity in the public governance sphere captured my resolve and led me to pursue a career in public management.
